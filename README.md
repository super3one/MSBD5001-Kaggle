# MSBD5001-Kaggle

Given the speed data of a major road in HK ranging from 2017/01/01 to 2018/12/31, the job is to predict the missing speed value in 2018. train.csv is the train data, and test.csv is the missing data needed to be filled in. And the predicted results is stored in the prediction.csv file. 

In this project, I use the linear regression and xgboost to fill in the value.

This project mainly use python language to complete, and the code is in the xgboost_updated.ipynb/xgboost_updated.py file. 

Only the code in "Fill-in value" part is used in generating the results for the results of "XGBOOST" part seems to be worse.

The packages needed for this project contain pandas, numpy, sklearn and xgboost.

You can get the results by running the "Fill-in value" part in xgboost_updated.ipynb file step by step.
